            <h2>Late</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, I wonder why the string was cut and the door was shut. I turn and see that it was delusional of me. To think that I would be forgiven, regardless of the things I've written. To see you cry and yet feel nothing in reply.

                <p>Oh how the winds have howled and voices drowned, to still feel my heart yearn and inevitably bound. To seek refuge in the weight, only to keep my mind away from cruel fate. Was it wrong to deicde for your well being, or was it a facade to avoid having to accept that I was just fleeing.</p>

                <p>Peer into my heart and know that I still hold true, the love that I once had for you. Will I ever overcome the wall that hinders me, or will the shackles that tie us set me free. A new beginning for us both, and I wish your heart does not loathe. </p>

                <p>How the tides have shifted and the days drifted. What once troubled me so, seemed to be ages ago. </p>

                <p>I collect my lions and gather the thought, and hope all this effort was not for naught. I open up and hope for the best, as a huge weight lifted off my chest. You told me I was sweet, but with this... I already knew you were complete. I smile and gave a hearty laugh, but I knew something inside me cut in half. At that point we were no more than acquaintances, I've realized that I've already used up all my chances.</p>

                <p>A single drop, but I just couldn't stop. Rain poured, and I knew this could not be ignored, but what culd I have done, in your eyes you have alerady won. It seems like I've never noticed that you in fact had two strings tied, through the years I've been blinded by my pride. And though I wish I had seen it before, what more could I ask for. You were happy anyway, and my heart would not allow me to betray. So here I sit, wondering why the string was cut and the door was shut. </p>
