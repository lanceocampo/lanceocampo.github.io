            <h2>Grown</h2>
            <p>We met while we were young, you were a beauty. Loved by many, I too had a curiosity for it, and who knew that one day it would be you and me. We progressed for years and I'd glady admit, I haven't had a realtionship as true. I was shy and you were energetic. An unlikely duo, that apparently lived. Quite a time we had, but of course short lived.</p>

            <p>For you had to sail, to islands unknown and left everyone but your love the most. As we parted ways you still continued to weep, and strangely enough we'd never meet. As time goes and seasons change. I will forget of you, and that is when the clock strikes, for your return.</p>

            <p>instead of resentment I receive gratitude, questionable, but true.</p>

            <p>I wish I had known of your adventures, but I too had my own, and the weight of your presence would slow me no longer. We both part ways and go about our lives. Only to be intertwined once more.</p>

            <p>And so we chat, about how it was. And you tell me it never left. What was I supposed to say except to nod away. What I saw in you was not what I once saw, You've grown up and it seemed that you were doing fine.</p>

            <p>That is when I understood, the gratitude you showed, and that is why you will always hold a place in my heart.</p>
