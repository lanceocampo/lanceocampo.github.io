            <h2>Tried</h2>
            <p>We were young delusional as we were, hastened into a relationship we were never prepared for. We thought we knew only to find out that it was not meant to be. I had my reasons and you had yours, but I believe it was for the benefit of us both.</p>

            <p>It was great while it lasted and I hope you feel so too, but the time we had was merely dreams of what it would have been. </p>

            <p>Though what turned out to be true, was false in the eyes of the bird. For the bird tweets for you and of it came the judgement of the people. It was fast and it was quick. Though I wish it was different, I couldn't ask for a better way to end it. We tried and we failed, we move and we grow. That's all there is to it.</p>
